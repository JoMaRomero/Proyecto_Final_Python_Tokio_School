# Final Project from Tokio School in Python

Final project in Python made with Flash and SQLAlchemy. 

Template B was used for this project, which consist of simulating a web page like Netflix.

## Try the project

To run it, open it with a IDE like VSC, create a venv with "python -m venv venv", then opening the venv writing ".\venv\Scripts\activate" in the terminal.

When in venv, use "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all the frameworks and libraries used on the project.

At last, write "py .\app.py" to start the flask server. Go to any browser and write http://127.0.0.1:5000 and you are free to try the page.

To access as a user, you can create a user on Register. Otherwise, you can access as a user with the following data:
- Username: Usuario
- Password: 11223344

If you want to access as admin:
- Username: admin
- Password: adminpass

Just in case, username and password are case sensitive so be careful about that. Maybe gonna change it in future updates.
