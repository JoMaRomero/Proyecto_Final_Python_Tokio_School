# Final Project from Tokio School in Python

Final project in Python made with Flash and SQLAlchemy. 

Template B was used for this project, which consist of simulating a web page like Netflix.

## Try the project

To run it, open it with a IDE like VSC, create a venv with "python -m venv venv", then opening the venv writing ".\venv\Scripts\activate" in the terminal.

When in venv, use "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all the frameworks and libraries used on the project.

At last, write "py .\app.py" to start the flask server. Go to any browser and write http://127.0.0.1:5000 and you are free to try the page.
